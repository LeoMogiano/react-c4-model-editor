## About C4 Model Editor

The C4 Model Editor in this repository is built using React and React Flow. The C4 model is a visual notation for documenting software architectures. It provides a way to represent different levels of abstraction in a clear and concise manner, making it easier to communicate and understand the structure of a software system.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code of the C4 Model Editor application.
  - `components/`: Contains React components used to build the application's UI and is used to visualize and manipulate the C4 model diagrams.

  - `App.js`: The main application component where the overall structure is defined.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of the application.
- `public/`: This directory contains static assets that will be served as-is by the development server.
